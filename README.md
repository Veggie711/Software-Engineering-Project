# Software-Engineering-Project

This repository contains the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), design artifacts, and implementation resources for an **AI-Powered Medical Chatbot for Disease Diagnosis and Prescription using Chest X-Ray Images**.  
The system uses a **CNN based deep learning model** to classify chest X-ray images into *Normal*, *Pneumonia*, or *COVID-19*, and provides a user-friendly chatbot interface for explanations and preliminary medical guidance.

## 📌 Project Overview
The project aims to improve accessibility to medical diagnostic support by integrating machine learning, medical imaging, and conversational AI. It assists users in:
- Uploading chest X-ray images  
- Receiving AI-driven diagnostic results  
- Interacting with a chatbot for interpretation and guidance  
- Accessing downloadable diagnostic reports  
- Receiving notifications regarding diagnosis completion  

## 🏗️ System Features
- Image upload and validation  
- Automated preprocessing  
- Deep learning-based diagnosis 
- Chatbot interaction module  
- Report generation 
- User and admin management  
- Email/SMS notifications
